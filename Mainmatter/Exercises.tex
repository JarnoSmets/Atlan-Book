The purpose of these exercises is to make the reader familiar with Atlan. To get a feel for the language. They should not be seen as a test of the knowledge of the reader but rather as a guide to get your bearings in Atlan.  


\noindent \textbf{Exercise 10.1 -- Creating a basic possessive sentence \& writing your own name} 

In this first exercise we will be translating the sentence “My name is …" this exercise will demonstrate how to combine words in Atlan to create new words in a simple and familiar context. 

We will start by creating the Atlan word for “my”. To help you along I will give you the Atlan translation\idx{translation} for “I”; EJ.AM \ej\am. “I” is composed of EJ \ej meaning person, and AM \am; 1st removed: speaker. The Atlan word for “my” can easily be made from this by adding the possessive prefix TA \ta. This leaves us with TA.EJ.AM \ta\ej\am.  

And what is the Atlan translation\idx{translation} of “name”? And “is”? (Note: “is” is a predicate and comes with a marker). Remember that the subject of an Atlan word always comes first in a sentence, so the word order\idx{word order} would be: Name my is [Name]. 

Now comes the easiest part of the sentence, your name. To write your name in Atlan all you must do is transliterate your name into Atlan’s set of 14 sound\idx{sound}s and put a cartouche\idx{cartouche} around\idx{sound} your name. %Now, what would be the Atlan translation\idx{translation}s of “My name is …"? 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Write your name in Atlan:
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\dotfill
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Exercise 10.2 -- Creating basic active sentences in the present simple tense} 

Now that we know how to create a basic possessive sentence, we are going to look at how to form basic active sentences. Like, “I am walking” and “He is writing”.  
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] What is the Atlan translation\idx{translation} for “I walk”, “You walk” and “He walks”? (Note: present tense has no need for a marker).  
\end{itemize}

\noindent And what is the English translation\idx{translation} of the following sentences? 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(ii)] EJ.AM TU.LIK EK.POK \ej\am \tu\lik \ek\pok  

    \item[(iii)] EJ.AJ TU.JIL EK.FIL\ej\aj \tu\jil \ek\fil  

    \item[(iv)] EJ.AM.ON TU.KOS.TOJ \ej\am\on \tu\kos\toj 
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Exercise 10.3 -- Creating basic sentences in the past simple tense} 

Now we move to the past simple tense. Translate the following English sentences to Atlan. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)]I worked. 

    \item[(ii)]We worked. 

    \item[(iii)]They worked. 

    \item[(iv)]You played yesterday. 
\end{itemize}
 

\noindent \textbf{Exercise 10.4 -- Numbers} 

Atlan’ number system can be used as a ten-base system and as a twelve-base system. To see the difference between these systems you can look at how to spell your name in both ten-base and twelve-base. We will begin with exercises that use the ten-base system as this will probably be more familiar. 

\noindent Translate the following sentences using a ten-base number system:

\phantom{.}\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)]I have three fish. 

    \item[(ii)]I have eleven fish. 

    \item[(iii)]I have a thousand fish. 
\end{itemize}
\noindent Translate the following sentences using a duodecimal\idx{duodecimal} (twelve-base) number system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(iv)]I have three fish. 

    \item[(v)]I have eleven fish. 

    \item[(vi)]I have a thousand fish. 

    \item[(vii)]I have a 1.728 fish.  
\end{itemize}
